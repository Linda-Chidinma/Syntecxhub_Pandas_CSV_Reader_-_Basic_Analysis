# Pandas CSV Reader & Basic Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of Pandas to read CSV data and perform basic exploratory data analysis. It was completed as part of the Syntecxhub Virtual Internship program.

## Project Objectives
- Read CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame
- Inspect data using head, tail, and data types
- Compute summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, maximum, and count
- Filter rows, select specific columns, and slice subsets of data
- Save filtered results to CSV and Excel formats

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Summary
A sample dataset was created to simulate real-world CSV data. The project focuses on demonstrating fundamental Pandas operations for data inspection, analysis, and data export.

## Reflection
This project helped reinforce my understanding of working with structured data using Pandas and performing basic data analysis in Python while maintaining a clean, portfolio-ready project structure.
